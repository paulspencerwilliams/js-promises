# Just a playground for me to play with JavaScript promises. 

Up until this repo, I've never deliberately used JS promises. There, I said it. I've used them, debugged them, and skirted around them. But never have I understood them sufficiently to see a callback, and think "I know, I need to replace this with a promise". 

This needed to change, so I had a little play and have a basic understanding of their benefits, syntax, and the `async`/`await` sugar to make them look a bit more synchronous.
